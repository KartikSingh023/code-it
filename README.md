# Remote Code Executer

This RCE project currently provides a basic API to execute programs on a remote server. Basic code validation is performed to prevent potentially malicious code.

## Functioning:

The API accepts POST requests to the `localhost:9000/code` endpoint. Check out DOCS.md for a detailed reference

### Request Body Keys:

- `key <String>` - A random string to uniquely identify each request

- `language <String>` - Represents the programming language to be used. Value is identical to the file extension used by the language

- `code <String>` - User provided code

- `input <String>` - User provided input for their code

### Supported Languages:

- Python3 (use: _py_)

- C++ (use: _cpp_)

- Node/Javascript (use: _js_)

## Code Validation:

Currently, code validation takes place by selectively rejecting or accepting libraries depending on the language. The list of libraries of concern are listed below

#### Python (Rejected Libraries):

- os

- subprocess

- shlex

- xml

- pickle

#### C++ (Accepted Libraries):

- iostream

- algorithm

- stdio

- cstdio

- vector

- math

- cmath

- cstring

- string

- deque

- iomanip

- iterator

- map

- queue

- set

- stack

- conio

- ctype

#### Node/Javascript (Accepted Libraries):

- readline

- buffer

- string_decoder

- timers

- stream

- util
